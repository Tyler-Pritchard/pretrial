## Overview

**Pretrial** is a first-person dark comedy horror game that blends the mundane monotony of office work with the absurdity of life inside a jail. Inspired by true experiences, the game thrusts players into the role of **Tyler**, a clerical worker navigating a bureaucratic hellscape where routine paperwork collides with bizarre, surreal events. It’s a game that breaks the mold of traditional horror by mixing psychological tension with the humor of shows like *The Office*.

In **Pretrial**, the horror doesn’t come from monsters or jump scares—it comes from the mundane, the unexplained, and the absurd. Players must complete their daily tasks while navigating an environment where every interaction could unravel into chaos. Guards, inmates, and co-workers are unpredictable, and every shift is a new challenge where "nothing makes sense" is the only constant.

## The Story Behind Pretrial
This game is deeply personal. **Tyler Pritchard**, the creator, spent years working in jail intake—a place where the unpredictability of life was in stark contrast to the numbing routine of clerical work. **Pretrial** captures that experience in a way that’s both relatable and disturbing. It’s a game where the environment, much like the real world it reflects, is constantly in flux. One minute you’re stamping forms, the next you’re handling bizarre inmate interviews, and at all times, you're just trying to survive the job.

## Why Pretrial?

**Pretrial** stands out because it mixes:

- **First-Person Horror**: But not the kind you're used to. There are no scripted jump scares or grotesque creatures; instead, you face a psychological maze where the horror comes from *within* the seemingly normal.

- **Dark Comedy**: The game merges the dry, absurd humor of mundane office work with the grim reality of a jail setting. Imagine a jail-themed episode of The Office where the stakes are existential.

- **True Story Immersion**: **Pretrial** isn’t a work of fiction—it's based on real experiences. That authenticity adds a layer of immersion you won’t find in any other horror game.

## Key Features

- **A Small, Intense Environment**: The entire game is set in a few connected rooms—a cluttered office, a small interrogation room, a bathroom, and an open intake area. Each room becomes a character of its own, with new events unfolding every time you return.

- **Unpredictable Characters**: Every NPC—from guards to co-workers to inmates—behaves in ways that are unexpected, reflecting the often irrational reality of the jail system. No two interactions are the same.

- **Procedural Surrealism**: Events escalate in absurdity, but unpredictably. Some days it’s a normal shift, and on others, things go completely off the rails. This randomness mirrors real-life unpredictability, keeping players on edge.

- **Office Work Under Pressure**: Complete mundane tasks under strange and often stressful conditions. From pushing papers to conducting bizarre inmate interviews, it's all about staying sane while the world falls apart.
  
## Market Appeal

- **Dark Comedy Fans**: If you're a fan of *The Office*, *Parks and Recreation*, or *It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia*, you’ll find yourself right at home with **Pretrial’s** offbeat humor.
  
- **Horror Fans**: Horror gamers are always on the lookout for something different. **Pretrial** delivers a fresh take on the genre, breaking away from traditional horror tropes to create something both unique and immersive.
